My Play Framework 2.0 , 2.1 snippets

This repo will contain some (i think) useful classes and methods for scala/play. 

I'm not a master scala programmer nor a functional programmer so these classes could contain some "not-so-functional" lines too. Sorry for that. 

I'm writing my first play application in my free time and I was surprised there is not so much code out there for it, for example I could'nt find a single pagination snippet that could paginate squeryl snippets, I searched a lot for a scala style slugify method and so on. 

I use play 2.1 with squeryl. 


TODO: Look for some method to include these extensions to play as simple as possible, maybe as a modul or plugin or project.
